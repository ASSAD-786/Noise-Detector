# Noise-Detector
This project is a simple and efficient noise detector built using basic electronic components like a microphone, BC547 transistors, and a 555 timer IC. It detects sudden sounds such as claps and responds by triggering an output like an LED or relay, making it useful for sound-activated automation systems.

# Features
Detects sound (like claps) using a condenser microphone

Amplifies weak audio signals using a two-stage transistor amplifier

Triggers a monostable 555 timer to activate an output for a fixed duration

Can be extended to control lights, fans, or security alarms
